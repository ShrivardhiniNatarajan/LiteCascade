# LiteCascade Progress Log

## Stage 0: Environment Setup & Initialization
**Date:** 2026-10-08
* **What was done:** 
  * Acknowledged non-negotiable rules.
  * Git was already initialized with remote origin by the user.
  * Created basic directory scaffolding (`src/`, `tests/`, `configs/`, `data/`, `checkpoints/`, `results/`, `docs/`).
  * Created strict `.gitignore` to prevent committing large files and datasets.
  * Created this `PROGRESS.md` tracking log.
* **Verification output summary:** Directory creation successful. Git status reflects untracked files properly ignoring `data/`, `checkpoints/`, and `results/`.
* **Known issues:** None so far. Waiting for explicit requirements for dependency setup (e.g. PyTorch, TFLite).

### Stage 0: Project Scaffold (completed)
* **What was done:** 
  * Updated directory layout (added __init__.py files, `configs/`, `scripts/`, etc.).
  * Added `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`, `README.md`.
  * Created `utils/seed.py` and `utils/config.py` with tests.
  * Initialized venv and installed all dependencies (`torch`, `tensorflow`, `ruff`, etc.).
  * Fixed lint errors and ran test suite successfully.
* **Verification output summary:** `make lint` passes with 0 errors. `pytest tests/` passes 5 tests in ~3.84s.
* **Known issues:** None.
